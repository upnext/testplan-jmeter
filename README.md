Testplan for jmeter
===================

* Download jmeter from [jmeter project page](http://jmeter.apache.org/)
* Load this testplan and read the comments
* Enjoy testing!


This is your inital testplan to start with your jmeter experiments. jmeter is a
tool to testing website - for mass destruction or for single testing to ensure
everything is working.

I am using this testplan as a starter template. Everything is commented, if you
run into trouble just drop me mail.

Right now, this is only a short documentation - it will grow over time.
